Villains: we all hate’em, but what would video games be without them? This week, Kirk, Jason, and Maddy try to figure out what makes a good bad guy. From Deathloop’s Julianna to Final Fantasy VII’s Sephiroth, antagonists can be brilliant and memorable. But why do we love to hate them? What makes them so fiendishly appealing? And just what is the deal with Kefka?
