What’s a video game? Let’s explain! On this very special episode of Triple Click, produced as part of Maximum Fun’s Block Party, hosts Kirk Hamilton, Jason Schreier, and Maddy Myers give you a beginner’s guide to gaming: the good, the bad, and the pixelated. First, a few definitions of what a “video game” actually is. Then, some recommendations for games you should play if you’re just getting started. And finally, our regular bonus segment, One More Thing.
