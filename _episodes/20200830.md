title: "Beanscast: Time Loop Movies"
type: bonus

Jason, Maddy and Kirk take a deep dive into four of their favorite time-loop stories: 1993’s Groundhog Day, 2014’s Edge of Tomorrow, 2019’s Russian Doll, and 2020’s Palm Springs. What are the rules for each of those four loops? How do the characters navigate those rules, and how do they eventually “win” the game? (Or do they?) There’s oh so much to talk about. Fortunately, we have all the time in the world.
