Kirk, Jason, and Maddy dive back into their ongoing playthrough of Final Fantasy VI, picking up where they left off last time (the Opera House) and going until the end of the Floating Continent. Do Maddy and Kirk like it more now? Whatâ€™s the deal with that flake Shadow? Why is Edgar such a creeper? And whoa, did Kefka really just do THAT?
