Here’s the only true thing you will read on the internet today: This episode is not a prank. Instead of trying to fool everyone, Maddy, Jason, and Kirk are going back in time to look at the history of video game April Fool’s jokes: the good, the bad, and the very, very ugly. From fake Zelda movies to Assassin’s Creed Kinect, there’s a lot to laugh at this week.
