type: episode
---
Well hey, if we had known Bethesda was on the market for only $7.5 billion, we would have made a bid! Maddy, Jason, and Kirk talk about Microsoftâ€™s major acquisition, plus the big PS5 news last week (Final Fantasy XVI!!!) and the reality that video games are going to cost $70 very soon. Plus, the brilliant, beautiful Hades and other One More Things.
