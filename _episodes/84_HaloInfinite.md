It’s Halo time! Maddy, Kirk, and Jason dive into Halo Infinite, the new game from Microsoft and 343 Industries. They talk about the story (bleh) and the grappling hook (yesssss) then get into the game’s rocky development, the very fun open world, and the truth behind Cortana. Plus: Succession season 3 talk!
