type: episode

Just what is the deal with indie games? When did they become financially viable? How did they become so popular? And what is “indie” anyway??? This week, Jason, Maddy, and Kirk look at the modern history of indie games, from Braid and Castle Crashers to the Nintendo Switch’s big bumps. They talk about the rise of digital distribution, some misguided old comments from former Nintendo boss Reggie Fils-Aime, and whether “indie” even means anything anymore.
