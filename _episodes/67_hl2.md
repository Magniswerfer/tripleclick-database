It’s finally time: Jason, Maddy, and Kirk pick up their gravity guns and move around some cardboard boxes so they can climb into Half-Life 2. The gang talks about the pros and cons of Valve’s classic shooter, how the game holds up in 2021, the G-Man, the graphics, the setpieces, the nauseating vehicles, and oh so much more!
