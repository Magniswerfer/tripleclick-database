        <h1>What’s The Deal With: The Game Awards?</h1>
            <p>It’s the most trailer-filled time of the year, when Santa Keighley slides down our internet-chimneys to hastily deliver some awards in between ads for upcoming games. Jason, Maddy, and Kirk go over the history of The Game Awards, discuss the controversies surrounding this year’s event, and of course, gripe about the games they wish had gotten more nominations.</p>

<p>Or any at all.</p>

<p>Because Wildermyth didn’t get a single nomination.</p>

<p>I KNOW RIGHT</p>
