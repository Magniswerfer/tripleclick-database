        <h1>Prepare For A Weird E3</h1>
        <p>E3 2021 is almost here, which means it’s time for HOPES, EXPECTATIONS, RUMORS, and VIDEO GAMES. This week, Kirk, Jason, and Maddy talk about what it’s been like preparing for a virtual E3 (blech), what they hope to see from each conference, and all of the hot gossip they’ve been hearing behind-the-scenes, from Assassin’s Creed to Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
