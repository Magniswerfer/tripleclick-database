        <h1>Activision, NFTs, and Other Gaming News</h1>
            <p>Happy Thanksgiving! If youâ€™re celebrating, grab yourself a turkey drumstick and listen to Kirk, Maddy, and Jason talk gaming news. From the ongoing Activision Blizzard crisis to the inexplicable rise of NFTs, it sure has been a weird fall in the video game world. This week, the gang talks about those and other big headlines, like the new consoles and the supply chain mess.</p>
