        <p>A TV show? About video games? Believe it, baby. On this month’s bonus episode, the Triple Click Trio tackles the first two seasons of Apple TV+’s game dev comedy Mythic Quest. How true does this show feel to the world of video games, and how much does that matter? What does Ian’s character arc say about the changing nature of TV comedy? How is Ashly Burch so awesome? Those questions and many more, answered (or attempted) on this spoiler-filled episode.</p>
