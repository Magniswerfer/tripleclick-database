            <p>It’s time for a Triple Play! Jason, Maddy, and Kirk have all played a whole lot of Deathloop, the time-twisting new game from Arkane. They break down what they like and don’t like about the game, diving into its unique structure, disappointing ending, and truly delightful little details.</p>
