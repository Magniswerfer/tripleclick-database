        <h1>Triple Play: Suikoden II</h1>
            <p>And now, for Jason’s dream episode: the gang plays Suikoden II! Kirk and Maddy give their impressions of the first 25% of the classic JRPG, from the very beginning through getting your very own castle. Do they love it as much as Jason? (No.) The three of them talk about the relationship between Riou and Jowy, the parts of the game that feel clunky in 2022, and what it’s like to recruit all those characters. Plus: Dracula!</p>
