        <h1>Beanscast: Portal, with Justin McElroy</h1>
            <p>Maddy, Kirk and Jason are joined by noted podcast enthusiast Justin McElroy to spill the beans on Portal, a 14-year-old game that really, really holds up. They also spill some beans on Portal 2, since you canâ€™t really talk about the first one without talking about the second one.</p>
