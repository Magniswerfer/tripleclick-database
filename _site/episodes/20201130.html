        <h1>Beanscast: Mel Brooks Movies</h1>
        <p>Maddy, Kirk and Jason re-watched three Mel Brooks classics: Blazing Saddles (1974), Young Frankenstein (also 1974!), and Spaceballs (1987) to see how they hold up today. Short version: Sometimes they hold up to a surprising degree, and other times they don’t. It’s an hour of bad puns, fart jokes, and an unexpected number of bumper sticker gags.</p>
