        <h1>Now We’ve Played The PS5 Too</h1>
            <p>Last week it was all things Xbox, and now it’s time for PlayStation 5! Jason has been using the fifth PlayStation for a few weeks now, and he’s impressed. The load times are fast and the controller is slick. But is it worth getting or should you just wait??? Plus: Spider-Man Miles Morales and the wonderful Bugsnax (talkin about Bugsnax)!</p>
