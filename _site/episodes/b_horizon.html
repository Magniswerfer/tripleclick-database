        <h1>Beanscast: Horizon Zero Dawn</h1>
            <p>Maddy has finished Horizon Zero Dawn, so it’s time for her, Jason, and Kirk to talk all about Aloy’s big adventure. What caused the world to end, and what caused it to begin again? Is Ted Faro more of a Musk or a Bezos? What would Lance Reddick be like in a Destiny raid? And what are we looking forward to in the game’s upcoming sequel?</p>
