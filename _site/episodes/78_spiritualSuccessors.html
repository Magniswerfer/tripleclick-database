        <h1>What’s The Deal With: Spiritual Successors?</h1>
            <p>Ever play a game that feels a whole lot like an older game? What’s the DEAL with that? This week, Jason, Maddy, and Kirk talk about spiritual successors, from Bloodstained (Castlevania) to Mighty No. 9 (Mega Man) and oh so much more. What are the different kinds of spiritual successors? Why are they so common in games? And why is Jason so excited for Eiyuden Chronicles??</p>
