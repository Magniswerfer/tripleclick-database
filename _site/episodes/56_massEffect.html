        <h1>Triple Play: Mass Effect</h1>
            <p>It’s Mass Effect time! Maddy, Jason, and Kirk are all playing the remastered version of BioWare’s sci-fi trilogy, and really, who needs an excuse to talk Mass Effect? The gang talks about what it’s like to revisit Mass Effect all these years later, what has or hasn’t aged well, and of course, who they’d all like to smooch.</p>
