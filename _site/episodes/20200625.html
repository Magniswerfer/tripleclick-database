        <h1>The Last of Us Part II (Part 2)</h1>
        <p>Jason and Kirk have gotten some time with The Last of Us Part II, and they have THOUGHTS. They talk to Maddy about the first half of the game (including spoilers for the first couple of hours) and dissect what they like and donâ€™t like. Later, the gang talks about the recent wave of sexual harassment allegations in the video game industry.</p>
