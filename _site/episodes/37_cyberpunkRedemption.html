        <h1>Cyberpunk 2077 And Other Video Game Redemption Stories</h1>
            <p>In the wake of Cyberpunk 2077, a game with a rocky launch that will now try to find redemption, Jason, Maddy, and Kirk take a look at some other video game redemption stories. They talk about No Man’s Sky, Destiny, Final Fantasy XIV, and other games that got better over time. What does a successful turnaround look like? And what are the ethical questions involved? All that and lots more.</p>
