        <h1>The Music of Final Fantasy VII</h1>
            <p>It’s time for a new segment called “Hey, Listen!”, where Kirk takes listeners deep inside the music for a given video game. This first edition focuses on 1997’s Final Fantasy VII, as well as some of the new arrangements from 2020’s Final Fantasy VII Remake. What makes the original game’s music so special? What new musical ideas are introduced in the Remake? And why is Aerith’s theme so magical? Put on your headphones for this one, and turn up the volume.</p>
