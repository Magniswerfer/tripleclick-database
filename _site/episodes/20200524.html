        <h1>Beanscast: Final Fantasy VII Remake</h1>
        <p>In the first bonus episode of Triple Click, Maddy, Jason and Kirk get together to “spill the beans” on Final Fantasy VII Remake. What did they think of the game overall? How about that ending? And what the heck might happen next? This episode includes FULL SPOILERS for Final Fantasy VII Remake, and at about the hour mark (with a warning), the hosts will also talk about the events of the original Final Fantasy VII.</p>
