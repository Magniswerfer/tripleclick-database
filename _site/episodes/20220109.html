        <h1>Beanscast: The Matrix Trilogy & Resurrections</h1>
            <p>Will you take the red pill or the blue pill? Or will you take the elusive third option, and follow the blue-haired woman with the white rabbit tattoo to an appointment with your analyst and his blue glasses? Whatever you choose, we hope you enjoy this beanscast in which Maddy, Kirk, and Jason discuss all four Matrix films: 1999’s The Matrix, 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, and 2021’s The Matrix: Resurrections.</p>
