        <h1>Beanstalk: Our Pasts & Futures</h1>
            <p>Maddy, Jason and Kirk are trying something different with this month’s bonus episode - it’s time for some BeansTALK, as the three of them share their personal stories and how they each wound up making a video game podcast together, as well as some of their plans and resolutions for 2021.</p>
