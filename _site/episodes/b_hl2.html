        <h1>Beanscast: Half-Life 2</h1>
            <p>Jason and Maddy have finished both episodes of Half-Life 2, so they sit down with Kirk to talk through the entire City17 saga, from the inbound train, to the outbound train, to the rocket ship. They then talk some about the “Epistle Three” that might have been, and what the ending of 2020’s Half-Life Alyx says about the possible future of the series.</p>
