        <h1>Early Thoughts On The Last Of Us Part II</h1>
            <p>Maddy brings on special guest Rob Zacny (Vice, Waypoint Radio) to give some early impressions on The Last of Us Part II. They talk about what the game accomplishes, why it didnâ€™t do what they hoped it would do, and they try to avoid spoilers while navigating that ridiculous embargo.</p>
