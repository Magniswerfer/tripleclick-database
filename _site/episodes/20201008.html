        <h1>Building A PC Is Super Fun</h1>
            <p>Is building a PC really that difficult? Or is it actually SUPER FUN? Maddy, Jason, and Kirk talk about each of their experiences buying PC parts and putting them together like beautiful, brilliant LEGO sets. Jason talks about why his gaming PC wouldnâ€™t turn on, Maddy reminisces on carrying her massive PC case to LAN parties, and Kirk espouses the virtues of thermal paste.</p>
