        <h1>Triple Play: Horizon Forbidden West</h1>
        <p>Robot… dinosaurs!!! Kirk, Jason, and Maddy take out their best bows and prepare to go on a hunt for big machines in Horizon Forbidden West, a new open-world game for the PlayStation that rules. They talk about how things have (and haven’t) changed from the first game, the big, beautiful world, and the good and bad of Forbidden West’s story.</p>
