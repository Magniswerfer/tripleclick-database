        <h1>The Great Ace Attorney, Or, Why We Love Visual Novels</h1>
        <p>We’re all about visual novels here at Triple Click. What’s that, you ask? What’s a visual novel? Well, allow Kirk, Maddy, and Jason to tell you: it’s kind of like a book… but better! Join us to talk about the stellar new game The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, the horniness of Fire Emblem and Persona, and why sometimes gameplay just isn’t all that great.</p>
