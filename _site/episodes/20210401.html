        <h1>The Best (And Worst) of Video Game April Fool’s</h1>
        <p>Here’s the only true thing you will read on the internet today: This episode is not a prank. Instead of trying to fool everyone, Maddy, Jason, and Kirk are going back in time to look at the history of video game April Fool’s jokes: the good, the bad, and the very, very ugly. From fake Zelda movies to Assassin’s Creed Kinect, there’s a lot to laugh at this week.</p>
