        <h1>Triple Play: Horizon Zero Dawn</h1>
            <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is out on PC, which makes for a good excuse to replay it! Or, in Maddyâ€™s case, playing it for the first time. The Triple Click gang hunt down some robots, become a member of the Nora tribe, and try not to crash their computers. Plus: One More Thing!</p>
