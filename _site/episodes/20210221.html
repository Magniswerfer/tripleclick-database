        <h1>Beanscast: The Mandalorian Seasons 1-2</h1>
            <p>For this month’s bonus episode, Jason, Maddy and Kirk put on their beskar helmets and jetpack straight into the rough and tumble world of Star Wars: The Mandalorian. It’s a wide-ranging discussion that goes from the specific (how can a helmet be so expressive?) to the broad (what are the most and least interesting things about Star Wars?), with plenty of detours along the way.</p>
