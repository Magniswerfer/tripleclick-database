        <h1>Triple Play: Metroid Dread</h1>
            <p>A new Metroid game is here, and by golly, it rules. Maddy, Jason, and Kirk put on their Varian Suits and take a deep dive into Samus Aran’s latest adventure, Metroid Dread, which came out earlier this month for Nintendo Switch. They talk about the game’s relentless pacing, the brilliant controls, and the endless stream of power-ups. They discuss the marauding EMMIs, the difficulty, and the meticulous design of each level. Metroid Dread: it’s a good video game.</p>
