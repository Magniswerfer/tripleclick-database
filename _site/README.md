# Triple Click Database
This repository contains a database / website for browsing all games (and potentially media) discussed by the [Triple Click podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/). If you like the podcast, please consider [donating](https://maximumfun.org/join).

I built this in Jekyll because I don't know how to host a proper website and make calls to a real databate, but that will come later. For now, this will do.

This is entirely a fan project, and is not affiliated with the Triple Click.
